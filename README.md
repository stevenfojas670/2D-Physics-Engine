# 2D Physics Engine (Pure JavaScript)

A lightweight, dependency-free 2D physics engine written in vanilla JavaScript. It includes:
* Custom collision detection
* Shape classes (Circle, Rectangle, Polygon)
* Rigidbody with forces and impulses
* 2D vector math utilities
* Movement/Integration system (delta time)
* Joints system (Spring, Force)
